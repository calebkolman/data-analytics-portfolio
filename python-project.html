      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        My goal was to identify trends and behaviors related to content moderation, including how flagged, deleted, ignored, or reported content affects user engagement. I also aimed to provide actionable insights to improve the efficiency of content review processes and optimize engagement across the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>High-Level Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Content:</strong> I analyzed over <strong>50,000 posts</strong> across all students.</li>
        <li><strong>Average Number of Posts Per Student:</strong> Each student averaged <strong>540 posts</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Average Percent of Flagged Content:</strong> 
          <strong>5%</strong> of all content was flagged by my system for review. This suggests that students tend to have a manageable portion of content requiring moderation. They also seem to have less of a history and may moderate their own content more effectively than the average user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Average Percent of Deleted Content (Flagged Content):</strong> 
          Only <strong>4%</strong> of flagged content was deleted, indicating that a small proportion of flagged content is deemed inappropriate. This highlights that the systemâ€™s flagging mechanism may be overly sensitive, resulting in false positives.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bar Graph 1 with Explanation</h3>
      <img src="notebooks/updated_days.png" alt="Bar Graph of Flagged Content Updates" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 1rem 0;">
      <p>
        The chart above shows the timeframes in which students returned to update their flagged content after the initial scan. Most updates occurred on the same day the content was flagged, accounting for <strong>1,784 posts</strong>. A smaller number of updates happened after more than a week (<strong>730 posts</strong>), with minimal activity observed the next day (<strong>45 posts</strong>) or within a week (<strong>25 posts</strong>).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The majority of user updates happen immediately on the same day, while a smaller secondary group returns after an extended period of over a week.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I analyzed how students interact with flagged content and the actions they take, such as deleting, ignoring, or reporting it. The majority of flagged content is addressed on the same day, while a smaller portion of students return after a week or more to address flagged content.
      </p>
      <p>
        My analysis revealed that <strong>10%</strong> of flagged content is ignored, compared to only <strong>4%</strong> being deleted. This suggests that much of the flagged content is not deemed inappropriate, or my flagging system might be overly sensitive.
      </p>

      <h2>Potential Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Review Flagging Sensitivity:</strong> 
          With <strong>10%</strong> of flagged content being ignored and only <strong>4%</strong> deleted, I plan to revisit the sensitivity of the flagging system to reduce false positives and ensure truly inappropriate content is flagged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Education and Engagement:</strong> 
          The low percentage of reported content (<strong>0.04%</strong>) suggests that students may not fully understand the reporting feature. I propose introducing new engagement strategies, such as a <strong>"Train our AI Day"</strong>, to encourage students to interact with the system effectively while learning about the report feature. Additional incentives might help boost participation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Moderation Tools:</strong> 
          I aim to implement more intuitive tools for students to moderate their content, such as a swipe interface similar to apps like Tinder, to make moderation faster and more engaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deep Dive into Ignored Content:</strong> 
          I plan to investigate why a significant portion of flagged content is ignored by analyzing patterns or surveying users to understand their choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitor Long-Term Engagement:</strong> 
          Most users only return to update content once. I propose sending email reminders about pending flagged content to encourage further engagement.
        </li>
      </ul>

 <h2>Python Code Showcase</h2>
<p>
  This project utilized Python extensively for exploratory data analysis, cleaning, statistical insights, and visualizations. Below are some key examples demonstrating my proficiency in working with data using Pandas, custom functions, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
</p>

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
<pre><code>
# Check data types
print(data.dtypes)

# Check the shape (number of rows and columns)
print(data.shape)

# Get summary statistics
print(data.describe(include='all'))

# Group by 'business_customer_id' to count the number of posts for each user
posts_per_student = data.groupby('business_customer_id')['id'].count()
</code></pre>

<h3>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h3>
<pre><code>
# Drop rows with any missing values
data_cleaned = data.dropna()

# Convert 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt' to datetime
data_cleaned['createdAt'] = pd.to_datetime(data_cleaned['createdAt'], errors='coerce')
data_cleaned['updatedAt'] = pd.to_datetime(data_cleaned['updatedAt'], errors='coerce')

# Calculate the difference in days between 'createdAt' and 'updatedAt'
data_cleaned['update_duration_days'] = (data_cleaned['updatedAt'] - data_cleaned['createdAt']).dt.days
</code></pre>

<h3>Custom Function for Classification</h3>
<pre><code>
# Define a function to classify the date difference
def classify_update_duration(days):
    if days == 0:
        return 'Same Day'
    elif days == 1:
        return 'Next Day'
    elif days <= 7:
        return 'Within a Week'
    else:
        return 'More than a Week'
</code></pre>

<h3>Statistical Insights and Visualization</h3>
<pre><code>
# Convert the counts to a DataFrame
classification_counts_df = classification_counts.reset_index()
classification_counts_df.columns = ['Update Duration', 'Count']

# Sort the values by the custom category order
classification_counts = classification_counts.sort_index()

# Set style
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a figure and axis object
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot the bar chart
classification_counts.plot(kind='bar', color=sns.color_palette("Blues_r", len(classification_counts)), ax=ax)

# Set title
plt.title('Days Returned After Initial Scan', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Set x and y labels
plt.xlabel('Timeframe Returned', fontsize=14, weight='bold')
plt.ylabel('Number of Posts Updated', fontsize=14, weight='bold')

# Rotate x-axis labels
plt.xticks(rotation=45, fontsize=12)

# Add gridlines
plt.grid(True, which='both', axis='y', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.7)

# Add data labels
for idx, value in enumerate(classification_counts):
    ax.text(idx, value + 1, str(value), ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=12)

# Display plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>
  These examples highlight my ability to clean and transform data, derive statistical insights, and create professional-quality visualizations that communicate actionable findings effectively.
